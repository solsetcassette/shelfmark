# 📚 Shelfmark: Book Downloader

Formerly *Calibre Web Automated Book Downloader (CWABD)*

<img src="src/frontend/public/logo.png" alt="Shelfmark" width="200">

Shelfmark is a unified web interface for searching and aggregating books and audiobook downloads from multiple sources - all in one place. Works out of the box with popular web sources, no configuration required. Add metadata providers, additional release sources, and download clients to create a single hub for building your digital library.

**Fully standalone** - no external dependencies required. Works great alongside the following library tools, with support for automatic imports:
- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)
- [Calibre-Web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web)
- [Calibre-Web-Automated](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated)
- [Booklore](https://github.com/booklore-app/booklore)
- [Audiobookshelf](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf)

## ✨ Features

- **One-Stop Interface** - A clean, modern UI to search, browse, and download from multiple sources in one place
- **Multiple sources** - Popular archive websites, Torrent, Usenet and IRC download support
- **Audiobook support** - Full audiobook search and download with dedicated processing
- **Real-Time Progress** - Unified download queue with live status updates across all sources
- **Two Search Modes**:
  - **Direct** - Search popular web sources
  - **Universal** - Search metadata providers (Hardcover, Open Library) for richer book and audiobook discovery, with multi-source downloads
- **Cloudflare Bypass** - Built-in bypasser for reliable access to protected sources

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose

### Installation

1. Download the [docker-compose file](compose/docker-compose.yml):
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/shelfmark/main/compose/docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. Start the service:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:8084`

That's it! Configure settings via the web interface as needed.

### Volume Setup

```yaml
volumes:
  - /your/config/path:/config # Config, database, and artwork cache directory
  - /your/download/path:/books # Downloaded books
  - /client/path:/client/path # Optional: For Torrent/Usenet downloads, match your client directory exactly. 
```

> **Tip**: Point the download volume to your CWA or Booklore ingest folder for automatic import.

> **Note**: CIFS shares require `nobrl` mount option to avoid database lock errors.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Search Modes

**Direct** (default)
- Works out of the box, no setup required
- Searches a huge library of books directly
- Returns downloadable releases immediately

**Universal**
- Cleaner search results via metadata providers (Hardcover is recommended)
- Aggregates releases from multiple configured sources
- Full Audiobook support
- Requires manual setup (API keys, additional sources)

### Environment Variables

Environment variables work for initial setup and Docker deployments. They serve as defaults that can be overridden in the web interface.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `FLASK_PORT` | Web interface port | `8084` |
| `INGEST_DIR` | Book download directory | `/books` |
| `TZ` | Container timezone | `UTC` |
| `PUID` / `PGID` | Runtime user/group ID (also supports legacy `UID`/`GID`) | `1000` / `1000` |
| `SEARCH_MODE` | `direct` or `universal` | `direct` |
| `USING_TOR` | Enable Tor routing (requires `NET_ADMIN` capability) | `false` |

See the full [Environment Variables Reference](docs/environment-variables.md) for all available options.

Some of the additional options available in Settings:
- **Fast Download Key** - Use your paid account to skip Cloudflare challenges entirely and use faster, direct downloads
- **Prowlarr** - Configure indexers and download clients to download books and audiobooks
- **IRC** - Add details for IRC book sources and download directly from the UI
- **Library Link** - Add a link to your Calibre-Web or Booklore instance in the UI header
- **File processing** - Customiseable download paths, file renaming and directory creation with template-based renaming
- **Network Resilience** - Auto DNS rotation and mirror fallback when sources are unreachable. Custom proxy support (SOCK5 + HTTP/S), Tor routing.
- **Format & Language** - Filter downloads by preferred formats, languages and sorting order
- **Metadata Providers** - Configure API keys for Hardcover, Open Library, etc.

## 🐳 Docker Variants

### Standard
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The full-featured image with built-in Cloudflare bypass.

#### Enable Tor Routing
Routes all traffic through Tor for enhanced privacy:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/shelfmark/main/compose/docker-compose.tor.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose.tor.yml up -d
```

**Notes:**
- Requires `NET_ADMIN` and `NET_RAW` capabilities
- Timezone is auto-detected from Tor exit node
- Custom DNS/proxy settings are ignored when Tor is active

### Lite
A smaller image without the built-in Cloudflare bypasser. Ideal for:

- **External bypassers** - Already running FlareSolverr or ByParr for other services
- **Fast downloads** - Using fast download sources
- **Alternative sources only** - Exclusively using Prowlarr, IRC, or other sources
- **Audiobooks** - Using Shelfmark exclusively for audiobooks

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/shelfmark/main/compose/docker-compose.lite.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yml up -d
```

If you need Cloudflare bypass with the Lite image, configure an external resolver (FlareSolverr/ByParr) in Settings under the Cloudflare tab.

## 🔐 Authentication

Authentication is optional but recommended for shared or exposed instances. Three authentication methods are available in Settings:

**1. Single Username/Password**

**2. Proxy (Forward) Authentication**

Proxy auth trusts headers set by your reverse proxy (e.g. `X-Auth-User`). Ensure Shelfmark is not directly exposed, and configure your proxy to strip/overwrite these headers for all inbound requests.

**3. Calibre-Web Database**

If you're running Calibre-Web, you can reuse its user database by mounting it:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /path/to/calibre-web/app.db:/auth/app.db:ro
```

## Health Monitoring

The application exposes a health endpoint at `/api/health` (no authentication required). Add a health check to your compose:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-sf", "http://localhost:8084/api/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 30s
  retries: 3
```

## Logging

Logs are available via:
- `docker logs <container-name>`
- `/var/log/shelfmark/` inside the container (when `ENABLE_LOGGING=true`)

Log level is configurable via Settings or `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

## Development

```bash
# Frontend development
make install     # Install dependencies
make dev         # Start Vite dev server (localhost:5173)
make build       # Production build
make typecheck   # TypeScript checks

# Backend (Docker)
make up          # Start backend via docker-compose.dev.yml
make down        # Stop services
make refresh     # Rebuild and restart
make restart     # Restart container
```

The frontend dev server proxies to the backend on port 8084.

The backend uses a plugin architecture. Metadata providers and release sources register via decorators and are automatically discovered.

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

### Copyright Notice

This tool can access various sources including those that might contain copyrighted material. Users are responsible for:
- Ensuring they have the right to download requested materials
- Respecting copyright laws and intellectual property rights
- Using the tool in compliance with their local regulations

### Library Integration

Downloads are written atomically (via intermediate `.crdownload` files) to prevent partial files from being ingested. However, if your library tool (CWA, Booklore, Calibre) is actively scanning or importing, there's a small chance of race conditions. If you experience database errors or import failures, try pausing your library's auto-import during bulk downloads.
